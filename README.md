### Things I can improve on: 
- Although the game currently works on both mobile and desktop, the styling needs to be adjusted to be suited for mobile devices
- Extract the drone entity into its own class
- Use an actual game engine like cocos creator or pixie js
- Improve animation of the explosion
- Improve the UI with better graphics as well as add texture and gradients to components
