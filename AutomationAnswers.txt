1. How would you select which automation tool is best suited for a project?
    * Depends on the software requirements. Like whether you need UI automation , DB automation  or API automation 

2. How will you go about automating the Movement of the drone?
    * I’d automate the movement of the drone by writing unit tests for each movement method and 
      entering in multiple permutations of dummy coordinates to test for each scenario 

3. How will your automation confirm that the drone has moved successfully to the correct location?
    * The automation will confirm that the drone is in the correct place by checking all edge cases as well as 
      negative tests and successful outcome tests

4. How will you automate and confirm that no other sequence of commands can be used before
   the Place command has been executed?
   * The place command is what should be populating the (x,y) values so if those values have not yet been established, 
   it means that the place command hasn’t been carried out. If the drone hasn’t been placed, then the automation would
   assert against what would be null x and y coordinates to ensure that no other commands can be carried out 

5. How will you go about automating and verifying that the drone does not go out of the boundary?
    * I’d assert against values that are greater than 9 for the x and y coordinates (0-9) when a place command / or any command 
    is carried out and expect the outcome to be a failure since the boundary sits at 9

6. Based on your Assessment requirements and your solution, what other automatable test scenarios can you identify?
    * Can automate the MOVE command by asserting against a (x + 1, y) or (x, y + 1) or any coordinates you want to test against. 
    You want to make sure it moves one unit in the direction it’s facing.
    * LEFT and RIGHT can be tested and the outcome of that will be North/South/East/West which can be determined by the REPORT method.
    * ATTACK can be tested whereby if the drone’s position is at (1,9,North). This will not allow you to fire as the projectile would 
      land at (1,11), which is out of the boundary
